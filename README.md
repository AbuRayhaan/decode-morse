![images](morse_code.PNG)

## Built With

- Ruby

## Setup

    - Install Ruby in local environment.
    - Run a program using command line.

## Prerequisites

- Understand Ruby basic syntax
- No linter errors.

### Project requirements

    - Create a method to decode a Morse code character, takes a string parameter, and return the corresponding character in uppercase (e.g. decode_char(".-") returns "A").

    - Create a method to decode an entire word in Morse code, takes a string parameter, and return the string representation. Every character in a word will be separated by a single space (e.g. decode_word("-- -.--") returns "MY").

    - Create a method to decode the entire message in Morse code, takes a string parameter, and return the string representation. Every word will be separated by 3 spaces (e.g.

        decode("-- -.--   -. .- -- .")
        returns "MY NAME").

    - Make sure that your code is DRY.

### Getting Started

To view the morse code;

    a) Clone the project

        ```terminal

        ```
    b) View the folder
        - cd into the project directory

            ```terminal
